# ***ROCK PAPER SCISSOR GAME***

```
* The application has been made using Tkinter Python Module hence it is fully GUI.

* The source code consists of a single .py file called rockpaperscissor_v2.py . Everything working in the application
 is all due to the code here.

* The application uses images which are stored in the Images folder.

* The cx_Freeze Python Module has also been implemented here to convert this program into an executable. Hence a
  computer without standard Python installation can also run this. But it has to be a 64-bit system. The setup file used
  to configure cx_Freeze has been added to this repo called setup.py

* The executable version of the application consists of the rest of the files in this repository. To run the executable
  version, double-click rockpaperscissor_v2.exe . The source code python file however has only been tested working in 
  Python 3.6 .
